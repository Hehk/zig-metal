# zig-metal - Zig Bindings to the Metal API

This library is currently in alpha stage, use it at your own risk.

Bindings are automatically generated using libclang, but there
still some issues with them.

In the examples folder you can find a few samples which are mostly directly
translated from apple's metal-cpp samples.
